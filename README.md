# Blackjack ‚ô†Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô£Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è

Blackjack, also called 21.

## Sample Game üìù

Set up a game with some number of players and some number of decks:

```python
import blackjack

game = blackjack.Game(min_bet=10)
game.standard_setup(number_of_players=1, number_of_decks=6)
game.play_game()
```

A typical game will look something like this:

```
Dealer
[T‚ô£ ??] [{10}]

Player_1 has ¬£500 with hand:
    [3‚ô• 8‚ô£] {11}  stake: ¬£10


Player_1's turn:

Playing hand [3‚ô• 8‚ô£] {11}
[h] Hit, [s] Stand, [d] Double down, [sp] Split?
Player chose DOUBLE_DOWN

Dealer [T‚ô£ 3‚ô£ 4‚ô¶] {17}


Player_1 [3‚ô• 8‚ô£ Q‚ô¶] {21}
Outcome: win

Play another round? [Y/n]
--------------------

Game ended with:
  - Player_1: ¬£510
```
